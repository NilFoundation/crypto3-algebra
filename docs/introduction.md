Crypto3.Algebra library extends the =nil; Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set algebraic constructions
 being used mostly for public-key schemes
 implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.

The library contains numerous elliptic curves ,algorithms for curve operations (ex : add,mul), field types, matrix & 
common matrix transformation operations.

 
Please see the following guides to have implement and extend the library:

* [Manual](@ref algebra_manual).
* [Implementation](@ref algebra_impl).
* [Concepts](@ref algebra_concepts).
